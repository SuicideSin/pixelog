pixelog is a simple way to track visits to a web page,
which doesn't require javascript.

RATIONALE

  When you need something simple to track static HTML
  page visits and don't want to pollute your site with
  javascript.

USAGE

  On the page we want to track, we include an <img> tag
  pointing to the tracking pixel on the pixelog server:

    <img src="http://pixelog.local/t.gif">

  If we want to include additional information, we simply
  add it to the url query string:

    <img src="http://pixelog.local/t.gif?page=home">

  We then start the pixelog server on pixelog.local:

    $ pixelog -l :80 -file "t.gif"

  When our page is loaded, pixelog outputs a log entry:

    2013/09/01 15:38:40 184.96.4.32 /t.gif?page=home "Mozilla/5.0" http://ref.co

  The fields in order of appearance: date, time, remote ip, request url, user-agent,
  referer.
